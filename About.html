            <p> I was born in NYC and the only spanish I speak is that which I picked up from my coworkers in a resteraunt.
                This project was not only an oppertunity to learn how to use html and CSS but also brush up on some Spanish
                which I rarely use. I actually study Japanese along side computer science so this whole project has been completely
                out of my comfort zone, but hey, trying new things can be fun... right?

            <p>Whether you have little to no Spanish skills or have grown up speaking the language,
              this website will help give insight into what is your current comprehensive level.
              With simple activities which will test your listening comprehension skills, basic
              translation skills, and simple communication skills, we will evaluate how well you
              understand the concepts necessary for basic communication is a Spanish environment.

          <div class="Mission-p2">
            <p>For these activities you will need access to headphones and a Spanish keyboard.
              Some lessons will require careful listening and writing. We will be testing you on
              grammar, spelling, and listening comprehension on various exercises. Although it may
              sound intimidating, our goal is for the exercises to be practice, rather than lessons
              or actual tests. There are absolutely no limit to retries of the exercises and it is
              strongly encouraged to retake exercises which posed difficulty to the viewer. Above all
              else we want the viewer to have as much fun as we did creating this website!
