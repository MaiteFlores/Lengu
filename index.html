                <p><i>Bienvenidos!</i> This website has been made by 3 computer science students who want to test and
                improve their computer science skills. We’ve learned how to make this program from scratch (without the help
                of templates or any other tools) and as a summer project, we wanted to make something that would have a use
                to the young (in education) spanish speakers who wish to test or practice their skills. We hope that someone
                is able to not only find our site on the internet, but also find some sort of usefulness in the skills tested
                and find the aesthetics we used in the website pleasant. This has been a group effort by up and coming seniors of
                Hunter College and we hope to improve on this site and eventually have a product which is not only presentable but
                fully functional and one that poses great use to those which are studying the Spanish language. </p>

                <p> With backgrounds in Mexico, China, and Jamaica we have painstaking made Spanish questions for individuals
                at the beginner intermediate and advance levels to test their skills. By no means can this be accurately used
                to test what level your Spanish is at, as none of us has had professional lessons or training at the intermediate
                or advance stages of the language. At most we hope to provide viewers with challenges which test their skills and
                allow students to remember basic conversational phrases</p>
